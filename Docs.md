### What is **ArbBot**?

>**ArbBot** is a self funded discord project that me **(Oreo ™#0018)** and one of my friends **(TMƧ ™#3854)** worked on for quite a while. Our purpose was to create a bot which contained most of the most requested commands and systems that every discord user has been asking for. This bot first started out as a way for me to test certain commands and events and it soon evolved into what you know now, ArbBot
